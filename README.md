# 📚 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms** repository! 🚀
This folder tracks my journey in mastering DSA, containing problem solutions, practice codes, and notes organized by sessions and topics.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The code is organized by date/session and by topic (DSA Sheet):

- **Thursday_22th_Jan/**: Initial practice code.
- **Tuesday_27th_Jan/**: Recent sessions.
- **Questions/**: Comprehensive DSA problems organized by topics.
- *(More folders will be added as I progress)*

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

I practice in both **C++** and **Java** to ensure versatility.

- **Languages**: C++, Java
- **Tools**: VS Code, MinGW (g++), JDK

## 🧩 DSA Progress (Sheet Topics)

The `Questions/` directory is organized by topic:

- **Basics/**: Patterns, Math, Recursion.
- **Arrays/**: *Rotate Image*, *Spiral Matrix II*, *Container With Most Water*, etc.
- **Binary_Search/**: *Median of Two Sorted Arrays*, *Search a 2D Matrix*, *Find Peak Element*, etc.
- **Strings/**: *Longest Palindromic String*, *Anagrams*, etc.
- **Linked_List/**: Full implementation from *Add Two Numbers* to *Design Linked List*.
- **Backtracking/**: *Valid Sudoku*, *Target Sum*, *Permutations*, *Combination Sum*, etc.
- **Stack_Queues/**: *Longest Valid Parentheses*, *Maximal Rectangle*, *Min Stack*, *Basic Calculator*, *Daily Temperatures*, etc.
- **Sliding_Window/**: *Sliding Window Maximum*, *Max Consecutive Ones III*, etc.
- **DP/**: *Arithmetic Slices*.

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run

### Standard Session Files
For files in date-based folders (e.g., `Tuesday_27th_Jan`):
1. **Navigate**: `cd ./Folder_Name`
2. **Compile**: `javac Filename.java`
3. **Run**: `java Filename`

### DSA Questions (Package-based)
The files in the `Questions` directory use packages (e.g., `package Questions.Stack_Queues;`). You must run them from the **root** directory (`d:\Paras\UNI_Docs\PEP\DSA`).

**Example: Running `BasicCalculator`**

1. **Compile**:
   ```bash
   javac Questions/Stack_Queues/BasicCalculator.java
   ```

2. **Run** (use the fully qualified name):
   ```bash
   java Questions.Stack_Queues.BasicCalculator
   ```

## 📌 Topics Covered

- **Basics**: Patterns, Basic Math, Recursion
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Strings, Stacks, Queues
- **Algorithms**: Binary Search, Sorting, Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Backtracking, Dynamic Programming
