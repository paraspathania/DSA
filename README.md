# 📚 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms** repository! 🚀
This folder tracks my journey in mastering DSA, containing problem solutions, practice codes, and notes organized by sessions.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The code is organized by date/session to keep track of daily progress:

- **Thursday_22th_Jan/**: Initial practice code.
- **Tuesday_27th_Jan/**: Recent sessions.
- *(More folders will be added as I progress)*

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

I practice in both **C++** and **Java** to ensure versatility.

- **Languages**: C++, Java
- **Tools**: VS Code, MinGW (g++), JDK

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run

### C++ Files 🔵
1. **Navigate to the directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ./Folder_Name
   ```
2. **Compile**:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ```
3. **Execute**:
   ```bash
   ./output
   ```

### Java Files ☕
1. **Navigate to the directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ./Folder_Name
   ```
2. **Compile**:
   ```bash
   javac Filename.java
   ```
3. **Execute**:
   ```bash
   java Filename
   ```
