# 📚 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms** repository! 🚀
This folder tracks my journey in mastering DSA, containing problem solutions, practice codes, and notes organized by sessions and topics.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The code is organized by date/session and by topic (Striver's A2Z Sheet):

- **Thursday_22th_Jan/**: Initial practice code.
- **Tuesday_27th_Jan/**: Recent sessions.
- **Questions/**: Comprehensive DSA problems organized by Steps (Basics, Arrays, Strings, etc.).
- *(More folders will be added as I progress)*

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

I practice in both **C++** and **Java** to ensure versatility.

- **Languages**: C++, Java
- **Tools**: VS Code, MinGW (g++), JDK

## 🧩 Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet Progress

The `Questions/` directory follows the Striver A2Z DSA Sheet structure:

- **Step 1 - Basics**: Patterns, Math, Recursion.
- **Step 3 - Arrays**: Solving problems like *Container With Most Water*, *Trapping Rain Water*, *4Sum*.
- **Step 4 - Binary Search**: *First Bad Version*, *Arranging Coins*, etc.
- **Step 5 - Strings**: *Longest Palindromic String*, *Anagrams*, etc.
- **Step 6 - Linked List**: Full implementation from *Add Two Numbers* to *Design Linked List*.
- **Step 9 - Backtracking**: *Valid Sudoku*.

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run

### Standard Session Files
For files in date-based folders (e.g., `Tuesday_27th_Jan`):
1. **Navigate**: `cd ./Folder_Name`
2. **Compile**: `javac Filename.java`
3. **Run**: `java Filename`

### DSA Questions (Package-based)
The files in the `Questions` directory use packages (e.g., `package Questions.Step_1_Basics;`). You must run them from the **root** directory (`d:\Paras\UNI_Docs\PEP\DSA`).

**Example: Running `PatternPrinting` from Step 1**

1. **Compile**:
   ```bash
   javac Questions/Step_1_Basics/PatternPrinting.java
   ```

2. **Run** (use the fully qualified name):
   ```bash
   java Questions.Step_1_Basics.PatternPrinting
   ```

## 📌 Topics Covered

- **Basics**: Patterns, Basic Math, Recursion
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Strings
- **Algorithms**: Binary Search, Sorting, Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Backtracking
